# 🚗 Vehicle Damage Forecast & Inconsistency Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project combines data science and business intelligence to analyze and forecast **vehicle damage trends**. It helps uncover inconsistencies in historical damage reports and predicts which vehicle models are more likely to experience damage in the future.

Built using **Jupyter Notebook (Python)** for data exploration and modeling, and **Power BI** for rich, interactive visualizations.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Vehicle manufacturers and service centers need to understand damage trends across different models and years. However, inconsistent damage reporting and lack of predictive insights hinder effective planning and resource allocation.

This project aims to:
- Detect anomalies and inconsistencies in damage records
- Forecast future damage counts by vehicle model
- Provide actionable insights using Power BI dashboards

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- ✅ Identify inconsistent or missing damage records
- ✅ Forecast damage counts for different vehicle models
- ✅ Visualize year-over-year changes and key insights
- ✅ Enable better decisions through interactive dashboards
